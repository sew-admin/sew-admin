							<p>Silver Eagle Games will be closing its retail location in Canton at the end of December 2018. It has been a fun and wild ride these past few years but it is time to move on to other endeavors. Our other business, Silver Eagle Wargame Supplies will continue to operate as a convention,&nbsp; mail order, and Internet based business and will be glad to provide you with all your gaming needs. We may even host events there from time to time. The number there is 860-651-6166. Leave a message at the beep!</p>
							<p>Thank you to everyone who patronized Silver Eagle Games. Many of you became regulars and lifelong friends. Our website and Facebook page will remain active for a while so check in from time to time. We hope to reopen someday and look forward to seeing you again.&nbsp;</p>
